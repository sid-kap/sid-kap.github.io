<p><strong>About me:</strong> I graduated from UT Austin in 2018, and am currently working at <a href="https://www.affirm.com">Affirm</a> in San Francisco. Iâ€™m interested in history, urbanism, and math, and will hopefully start blogging about those topics here.</p>
<p>I am also on <a href="http://twitter.com/sidkap_">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://github.com/sid-kap">Github</a>.</p>
