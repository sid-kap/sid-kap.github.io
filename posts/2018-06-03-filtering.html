For the sake of this essay, we’ll define “affordable” rent as less than 30% of the 25th percentile household income of the metro area—so [insert figures for New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston]. Since this is less than the rent needed to support new construction at current construction costs, the question becomes: In the lifetime of a house, under what conditions would the value of the house decline (i.e. filter) to the point where these lower rents are feasible?</p>
<p>One more consideration: we ask whether this can happen without the housing being in a slum. By this, we mean that the immediate area has plenty of jobs, is racially and economically diverse, the schools are not segregated, and crime and pollution are low.</p>
<p>This question can be approached empirically (by studying loosely-zoned housing markets), but here we will discuss the theory. Market urbanists argue that the market creates affordable housing through filtering, so here we will ask: What conditions are required for filtering to happen? Can it happen without the creation of slums?</p>
<p>Possible answers to this question are 1) No, filtering never happens 2) Yes, filtering happens but only through developer stupidity/creation of slums 3) Yes, filtering happens even if developers are intelligent and omniscient. It does not require creation of slums.</p>
<p>Why we’re associating developer stupidity with slum creation will soon become clear.</p>
<p>We will the conditions that might lead to each of these three answers.</p>
<h1 id="scenario-1-no-filtering-never-happens">Scenario 1: No, filtering never happens</h1>
<p>Suppose that rich people build houses for themselves, and they never have any reason to move. As a result, poor people never inherit rich peoples’ old houses (and they are never able to afford new construction anyways). In this scenario, poor people end up on the streets, in expensive units that are overcrowded, or end up moving to places where construction costs are cheaper (e.g. shantytowns). What conditions would bring about this outcome?</p>
<p>The main condition would be that the desirability of locations never changes. Jobs never leave the desirable areas where the rich have already built their homes. Nor do pollution or crime or racism cause rich people to value their homes less. So, filtering never happens.</p>
<h1 id="scenario-2-yes-filtering-happens-through-slum-creation">Scenario 2: Yes, filtering happens through slum creation</h1>
<p>In this scenario, the desirability of places (i.e. land values) naturally varies over time and unpredictably. One decade there are tons of jobs in an area, the next the factory closes or pollution or crime increase or a different kind of living environment comes into vogue. Developers can’t predict what will be hot in 10 years, so society (or to be precise, the part of society that can afford new construction) wastes a lot of money building homes in the area that happens to be popular in that decade. When desirability shifts, houses whose construction cost was lower than marginal demand a decade earlier now sell at a lower rate (i.e. lower than the cost at which it was constructed). Everyone who lives here, of course, was able to afford market-rate rent here when it was hot, so they should be able to afford market-rate rent in the new desirable area as well. So they all move out. (This is white flight.) Poorer people can now afford the area, but there are only poor people left. So this is filtering, via slum creation.</p>
<h1 id="scenario-3-yes-filtering-happens-but-without-slum-creation">Scenario 3: Yes, filtering happens, but without slum creation</h1>
<p>This is basically scenario 2, but with a very minor change. We see the same pattern of desirability change and shift in the areas where new construction happens. The difference is that this happens at a smaller scale—for example, street-level rather than neighborhood-level in dense cities (or elementary-school-zone level instead of high-school-zone level in lower-density cities). As in scenario 2, the immediate surroundings—the street, or the elementary school zone—have declined in value, and are now inhabited by poor people. But because the effect was at a small scale, this now-poor area has not become a slum, because desirable areas are still a stone’s throw away. There may be no jobs on the street, but there are still jobs in the neighborhood; the elementary school may have become economically or racially segregated but the middle school and high school it feeds into have not.</p></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
