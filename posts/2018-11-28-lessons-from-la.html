Here are some ways in which what I saw changed my opinions about cities.</p>
<h2 id="mixed-use-is-overrated-malls-are-better">Mixed-use is overrated, malls are better</h2>
<p>The most pleasant shopping areas in LA are commercial-only. I’m thinking of The Grove, Westfield Century City mall, Rodeo Drive, Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, Downtown Pasadena, the Venice Boardwalk, various malls in Koreatown, and various plazas/strip malls in the SGV, Koreatown, and along Wilshire and Santa Monica Blvds in the Westside. What makes these places pleasant?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specialization.</strong> Commercial trips usually fall under one of two categories—places you visit on ordinary days (groceries, haircuts, gyms, food, etc.), and places you visit for fun with friends or family (shopping, entertainment, food). The shopping mall acknowledges this dichotomy, packing high densities of fun places and not wasting space on boring things, like CVS or schools or random residential or office buildings, that you don’t need when hanging out.<span><a href="#sn-1" class="sidenote-number"></a><span id="sn-1" class="sidenote">Caveat: some malls do have salons and gyms, so this is not 100% true.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li>
<li><strong>Extremely high density of shops.</strong> Lots of businesses one after another, with no gaps in between. Often there are even multiple levels of shopping (in the malls and strip malls). You can take one trip to the mall and access dozens of places by short walk.</li>
<li><strong>Activity that would be disruptive in a residential area.</strong> Street musicians and dancers, music playing, bright lights and screens, street vendors.</li>
<li><strong>Nice touches as a result of a single owner.</strong> The owner of the complex, or the city in the case of Rodeo Drive and Venice Boardwalk, adds things like plants or grassy strips, benches, balconies, etc. The Grove and Rodeo Drive had Christmas decorations and music playing.</li>
</ul>
<p>American urbanists often ignore the benefits of malls, either from a libertarian or anti-corporate lens (think Strong Towns), for authenticity and grassroots urbanism (think Jane Jacobs), or because of the American association of malls with large parking lots. Japanese malls are (rightfully) brought up sometimes, but American and Western European malls are not. London’s Oxford Street, New York’s SoHo and Garment District, Flushing’s Downtown, and Chicago’s Magnificent Mile are effectively malls, but we don’t acknowledge this or ask ourselves why these places are good and whether they should be replicated.</p>
<p>Instead, the type of retail urbanists most often praise is ground-floor, mixed-use retail in residential areas, usually in midrise or taller apartment buildings. Obviously this is merited—more of the first type of retail I mentioned above should be built walking distance to homes. But this point can often be misinterpreted, to suggest that this is the pinnacle of retail—that all retail should be homogenously mixed into residential areas. People often debate whether housing should be built uniformly throughout cities as missing middle or clustered densely around transit (with Alon Levy as the strongest advocate of the latter approach). My argument is somewhat a retail analogue of Alon’s point. First, there are agglomeration effects of retail (basically the four bullet points above). Second, for more specialized types of retail with limited demand (e.g. Indian grocery) or retail with benefits to scale (e.g. movie theaters, department stores), it makes more sense to put it in places accessible to more people, near major roads or transit, rather than in a residential area and accessible only to those who live walking-distance.<span><a href="#sn-2" class="sidenote-number"></a><span id="sn-2" class="sidenote">The strongest version of this argument, which I’m not sure I believe in, is that we need multistory commercial zoning on big roads, multistory residential zoning on small roads, and no mixed zones.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Finally, clusters of retail usually makes sense because of the density of the average American city. Most American cities aren’t dense enough to provide enough foot traffic for retail in residential areas. In these places, low-carbon retail trips would either be made by bike or e-scooter (in which case putting it a few blocks away is fine), or could be done by foot only if multiple errands can be done in one walk (e.g. by putting retail near other retail, or near bus stops).<span><a href="#sn-3" class="sidenote-number"></a><span id="sn-3" class="sidenote">In fact, most European cities aren’t dense enough either—which is why most streets in London and Berlin, both under 15,000/sq mi density, are purely residential. Paris and Manhattan (both around 70,000 people/sq mi) are the only Western cities dense enough that most streets should have retail.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<h2 id="green-space-and-quiet-is-good">Green space and quiet is good</h2>
<p>Growing up, I never found my Dallas suburb to be particularly beautiful, so of course when I became interested in urban planning my idea of beauty in cities eschewed suburbs and looked to aspects of dense cities: pretty buildings, street activity, interesting retail. But parts of Los Angeles are suburban <em>and</em> beautiful, in a very suburban way. Pasadena was the best example of this.</p>

<p>This is far from an original observation. And obviously, aesthetics are not a good reason to underbuild and keep people out of high-opportunity regions or neighborhoods, or to force people to drive more. But it convinced me that there is <em>something</em> to people’s preference for yards, grassy strips by the sidewalk, lower lot coverage, and lack of retail (though obviously very few people have the money to pay for great landscaping like this). While Brooklyn tenements were my favorite housing type earlier, I’m now less convinced that the rest of America has to look like Brooklyn. We could probably build a low-carbon city that still has yards, grassy strips and quiet, low-rise residential areas if we sacrifice some walkability, embrace bikes and e-scooters, and decrease rail construction costs so that rail pencils out even in medium-density areas. And if yards and quiet and light is what people want, maybe that should be our goal.</p>
<h2 id="suburban-retail-can-be-nice-with-better-design">Suburban retail can be nice with better design</h2>
<p>Pretty much all the retail I saw in LA either abutted the sidewalk or had only one or two rows of parking in front. They manage to do this by either putting the parking in the back, on the side, or underground. This makes the retail more walkable, and also makes the city more interesting to look at even if you’re in a car. I’m curious how this happened—most places in America build strip malls with huge parking lots in front, since that’s the cheapest option and the most convenient to drivers.</p>
